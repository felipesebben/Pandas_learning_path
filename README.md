# Pandas Learning Path

These are a set of 13 courses, tutorials, and projects curated by Real Python - [Pandas for Data Science](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/pandas-data-science/). 
Once again, thank you all from Real Python for these top quality material!
So, I will be uploading here all my work.

Contents covered so far:
## 1. (Course) [Explore your Dataset with Pandas](https://realpython.com/courses/explore-dataset-with-pandas/), by Douglas Starnes

- Lessons on basic data exploratory analysis, which involve accessing, aggregating, querying, changing, and cleaning data. I have learned to:
    - Calculate data metrics
    - Perform basic queries and aggregations
    - Discover and handle incorrect data, inconsistencies, and missing values
    - Visualize data with plots

- [Certificate](https://realpython.com/certificates/1965029a-7866-48cb-af22-d9f85b13fa08/)
## 2. (Course) [The Pandas DataFrame: Working With Data Efficiently](https://realpython.com/courses/pandas-dataframe-working-with-data/), by Cesar Aguilar

- This was an in-depth course on specific features of pandas DataFrame. Several aspects of this object were discussed, such as dealing with time and missing data. 
Overall, I have learned:
    - What a Pandas DataFrame is and how to create one
    - How to access, modify, add, sort, filter, and delete data
    - How to handle missing values
    - How to work with time-series data
    - How to quickly visualize data

## 3. (Tutorial) [Pandas Sort: Your Guide to Sorting Data in Python](https://realpython.com/pandas-sort-python/), by Spencer Guy

- In this tutorial, I got acquainted with the many possible uses of pandas sort methods, namely, `.sort_index()` and `.sort_values()`. I learned how to:
    - Sort a pandas DataFrame by the values of one or more columns
    - Use the ascending parameter to change the sort order
    - Sort a DataFrame by its index using .sort_index()
    - Organize missing data while sorting values
    - Sort a DataFrame in place using inplace set to True
 

## 9. (Tutorial) - [Pandas GroupBy: Your Guide to Grouping Data in Python](https://realpython.com/pandas-groupby/), by Brad Solomon

- This tutorial used a few small projects to show the importance of pandas `GroupBy` as an indispensable tool in data analysis. Datasets from US Congress, air quality tests, and news aggregators were used in an interestingly and practical way.
I learned:
    - How to use Pandas GroupBy operations on real-world data
    - How the split-apply-combine chain of operations works
    - How to decompose the split-apply-combine chain into steps
    - How methods of a Pandas GroupBy object can be placed into different categories based on their intent and result

## 13. (Project) - [Using Pandas to Make a Gradebook in Python](https://realpython.com/courses/gradebook-using-pandas-python/), by Cesar Aguilar

- This project used Python and pandas functionalities to build a gradebook, similar to a spreadsheet. Throughout the activities, I learned how to:
    - Load and merge data from multiple sources with pandas
    - Filter and group data in a pandas DataFrame
    - Calculate and plot grades in a pandas DataFrame
- [Certificate](https://realpython.com/certificates/b9241ca5-7515-4f0a-8c93-2bf29eceee5b/)
