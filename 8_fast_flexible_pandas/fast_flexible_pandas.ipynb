    "<h1><b>Fast, Flexible, Easy and Intuitive: How to Speed Up Your pandas Projects</b></h1>\n",
    "<p>This notebook will cover a great tutorial taught by <a href=\"https://realpython.com/team/jwyndham/\">Joe Wyndham</a> on how to get the most out of pandas in terms of performance. By the end of his remarks, we get to understand the real power of pandas and to demytify the saying that pandas is too slow. We get to learn that the main problem is <b>applying a Pythonic logic in a library that was created based on other structures.</b> The main difference here is that pandas is designed for <b>vectorized operations</b> - keep that in mind -, a concept we will discuss along the following notes.</p>\n",

    "   <h3><b>Intermission</b> | On vectorized operations</h3>\n",
    "<p><b>Vectorized operations</b> in pandas are a fundamental concept that contributes to the efficiency and power of the library. Pandas is built on top of the NumPy library, which provides support for array computations. Vectorized operations allow you to perform operations on entire arrays of series of data <b>without the need for explicit iteration</b>, resulting in significantly fast and more concise mode.</p>\n",
    "<p>Here are some considerations about vectorized operations in pandas:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li><b>Element-wise operations</b>. Liky NumPy, pandas supports element-wise operations, which means that you can apply a function or arithmetic operation to <b>every</b> element in a Series or DataFrame <b>without needing to loop through each element</b>.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Broadcasting</b>. Pandas allows for broadcasting, which means you can perform operations <b>between arrays or series of different shapes</b>. The smaller array is automatically \"broadcast\" over the larger one to match dimensions, making the operation possible. This is similar to broadcasting in NumPy.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Performance Benefits</b>. Vectorized operations are much faster than equivalent operations performed using loops, as they take advantage of underlying <b>C</b> or <b>Cython</b> implementations for computations. This is particularly important when dealing with <b>large datasets</b>.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Code Readability</b>. Using vectorized operations can lead to more concise and readable code. You can express complex operations in a single line of code, improving the maintainability of your codebase.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Examples</b> of vectorized operations in pandas:</li>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Arithmetic operations - you can sadd, subtract, multiply, or divide entire Series or DataFrames element-wise.</li>\n",
    "<li>Element-wise functions - applying functions like <code>numpy.sqrt()</code>, <code>numpy.log()</code>, etc, to a Series or DataFrames.</li>\n",
    "<li>Comparison operations - you can perform element-wise comparison, resulting in boolean Series, which can be used for filtering.</li>\n",
    "<li>Conditional operations - using <code>numpy.where()</code> or pandas' <code>.loc[]</code> to perform conditional assignments.</li>\n",
    "<li>Mathematical operations - computing aggregates like mean, sum, median, etc, directly on Series or columns of DataFrames.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<p>Going back to our notes, let's consider pandas' first alternative: <code>.isin()</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>The code <code>df[\"cost_cents\"] = df[\"energy_kwh\"] * 28</code> is an example of a vectorized operation. To apply condition calculations as vectorized operations, we can group parts of the DataFrames based on the conditions we stipulate, and then apply the vectorized operations to each selected group. To do this, <code>.isin()</code> can be of great assistance - we select rows nd then apply the appropaiate tariff. We can first set <code>date_time</code> as our index to make our job easier.</p>"

    "<h2><b>11. Conclusions</b></h2>\n",
    "<p>In this notebook, we saw how we should think pandas as a powerful, fast, and flexible tool. As data analysts jumping into the world of Python, we are not given the time to understand how pandas behaves and works differently than Pythonic logic - we just use both together expecting the best result. As the author of this lesson has shown, that is not the case <b>at all</b>. Instead of getting frustrated with the library when dealing with larger datasets, we can apply some rules of thumbs that will make improvements ro runtime and code readability:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Try to use <b>vectorized operations</b> whenever possible. If your using too many <b>for</b> loops, maybe you should consider working with Python native structures.</li>\n",
    "<li>If you hae more complex operations in which vectorization is not an option or not the most efficient option, try to use <code>.apply()</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>If you need to loop over your array, use <code>.iterrows()</code> or <code>.itertuples()</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Keep in mind that there are lot of ways to accomplish the same result in pandas, so think about the one that works best in the context of your project.</li>\n",
    "<li>Once you've got a data cleaning script built, avoid reprocessing by storing your intermediate results with HDFStore.</li>\n",
    "<li>Integrating NumPy into pandas oeprations can often improve speed and simplify syntax.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>And that was it! That was a great tutorial by <a href=\"https://realpython.com/team/jwyndham/\">Joe Wyndham</a>, whom I thank once again for putting together such valuable lesson!"
